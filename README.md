- Check the machine's resource status.
- Process payments.
- Make coffee if resources and payment are sufficient.
- Turn off the machine.

## Modules
The program is divided into several modules:
- `menu.py`: Contains the `Menu` and `MenuItem` classes, which manage the drink options.
- `coffee_maker.py`: Contains the `CoffeeMaker` class, which manages the machine's resources and coffee-making process.
- `money_machine.py`: Contains the `MoneyMachine` class, which handles payment processing.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/coffee-machine.git
    cd coffee-machine
    ```

2. Make sure you have the necessary modules (`Menu`, `MenuItem`, `CoffeeMaker`, `MoneyMachine`).

3. Run the program:
    ```python
    from menu import Menu, MenuItem
    from coffee_maker import CoffeeMaker
    from money_machine import MoneyMachine

    menu = Menu()
    coffee_maker = CoffeeMaker()
    money_machine = MoneyMachine()
    is_on = True

    while is_on:
        options = menu.get_items()
        choice = input(f"What would you like? ({options}): ")
        if choice == "off":
            is_on = False
        elif choice == "report":
            coffee_maker.report()
            money_machine.report()
        else:
            drink = menu.find_drink(choice)
            if coffee_maker.is_resource_sufficient(drink):
                if money_machine.make_payment(drink.cost):
                    coffee_maker.make_coffee(drink)
    ```
